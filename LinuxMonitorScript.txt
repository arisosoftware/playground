The duty of System Administrator is really tough as he/she has to monitor the servers, users, logs, create backup and blah blah blah. For the most repetitive task most of the administrator write a script to automate their day-to-day repetitive task. Here we have written a shell Script that do not aims to automate the task of a typical system admin, but it may be helpful at places and specially for those newbies who can get most of the information they require about their System, Network, Users, Load, Ram, host, Internal IP, External IP, Uptime, etc.

We have taken care of formatting the output (to certain extent). The Script don’t contains any Malicious contents and it can be run using Normal user Account. In-fact it is recommended to run this script as user and not as root.

How Do I Install and Run Script?

First, use following wget command to download the monitor script "tecmint_monitor.sh" and make it executable by setting appropriate permissions.

It is strongly advised to install the script as user and not as root. It will ask for root password and will install the necessary components at required places.

To install "tecmint_monitor.sh" script, simple use -i (install) option as shown below.

Enter root password when prompted. If everything goes well you will get a success message like shown below.

After installation, you can run the script by calling command 'monitor' from any location or user. If you don’t like to install it, you need to include the location every-time you want to run it.

Now run monitor command from anywhere using any user account simply as:

Conclusion

This script is working out of the box on a few machines I have checked. It should work the same for you as well. If you find any bug let us know in the comments. This is not the end. This is the beginning. You can take it to any level from here.

We’ve received few complaints that the script is not working on the few Linux distributions, and one of our regular reader Mr. Andres Tarallo, has taken the initiative and made the script compatible with all Linux distributions, you can find the updated script on GitHub at https://github.com/atarallo/TECMINT_MONITOR/.
